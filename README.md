Files for getiing the SFS for a particular functional element from SLiM output
Using previously written modules
Project started on 21/11/2015

The script(s) in this repo, require SLiM output to be stored in a particular fashion:
For example:

INPUT...
...
OUTPUT: R XX pX XX
......
......
None # End of file


This is just how I store SLiM files, so that they can be stored tidily and then gzipped

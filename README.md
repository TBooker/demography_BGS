Files for getiing the SFS for a particular functional element from SLiM output.

The aim of this script is to generate, for a given set of SLiM runs, a file of SFS for each element type. These can then be used for other purposes

Using previously written modules
Project started on 21/11/2015

The script(s) in this repo, require SLiM output to be stored in my particular fashion, see the example file (slim_storage.txt)

This is just how I store SLiM files, so that they can be gzipped and stored tidily.
